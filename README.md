# Clicky Game

### Overview

Clicky Game is a simple app I created using React.js to familiarize myself with the React framework.  The goal of the game is to click all twelve unique cards, which is difficult because the cards are shuffled after each click using a Fisher-Yates algorithm.  To play the game, visit the link below.  Good luck!
